### Hi there, I'm David!

ðŸ‘‹ Hey! If you're seeing this, it means you stumbled upon my Github profile for some reason. Well, since I have you here, let me introduce myself. I'm David, a self-taught 17-year-old <sub><sup>(that was a lot of hyphens)</sup></sub> software developer living in Mississauga, Ontario. I build software using modern web technologies - mainly for schools and non-profits. I started off with a few [not-so-stellar hackathon projects](https://devpost.com/software/homify), and worked my way up to making full stack web apps with thousands of users, like [an online student election platform in response to COVID-19](https://github.com/fraser-votes). 

Currently, I'm working at [TakingITGlobal](https://takingitglobal.org) as a Software Architect - outside of work, you'll find me playing tennis down at the local courts, making more side projects, jamming to music, or organizing [FraserHacks](https://fraserhacks.ca).

Here's what I'm playing on Spotify right now - kind of eclectic lol.
