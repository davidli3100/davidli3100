### ðŸŽ¾ David Li

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! If you're seeing this, it means you stumbled upon my Github profile for some reason. Well, since I have you here, I'm David, a 17 year old living in Mississauga, Ontario. I'm 100% self taught, and I build software using modern web technologies - mainly for schools and non-profits. I started off with a few not-so-stellar hackathon projects, and worked my way up to making full stack web apps with thousands of users, like [an online student election platform in response to COVID-19](https://github.com/fraser-votes). I'm currently working at [TakingITGlobal](https://takingitglobal.org) as a Software Architect, but outside of work, you'll find me playing tennis down at the local courts, making more side projects, or organizing [FraserHacks](https://fraserhacks.ca).
